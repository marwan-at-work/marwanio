Hi There!

My name is Marwan and I am a passionate software person. I am also a musician, and an immigrant/refugee/person from Baghdad.

I am currently slightly obsessed with Golang and its community. Mainly because people are building some [seriously awesome $#*!](https://www.awesome-go.com) with the language.

Whenever I need a break, I will probably come here and write about stuff that I'm doing. I will, to the best of my abilities, try to keep it interesting and different. Mainly, because there's already **a ton** of introductory tutorials and workshops.

The first thing I'd like to write about is [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) & [Vecty](https://github.com/gopherjs/vecty), which is what I built this design-lacking website on.

Then I might take you on a tour of [Baghdad](https://www.github.com/marwan-at-work/baghdad), a distributed CI that I recently built.
